I am currently enrolled as a student at Jefferson State Community College in Birmingham, AL, and am expecting to graduate with my Associate's Degree in Computer Information Systems in December 2017. While at JSCC, I was involved with extracurricular activities, participating on the College Scholars' Bowl team for 5 semesters and serving as the captain for 3.
