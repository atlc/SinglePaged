## Jefferson State Community College, 2017 

I received my Associate's Degree in Computer Programming with a 3.26 GPA from Jefferson State Community College. I was the recipient of the Jefferson State College Scholar award in 2016.

I was involved with extracurricular activities, participating on the College Scholars' Bowl team for 5 semesters and serving as the captain for 3. I concluded my Scholar's Bowl career as the second highest scorer in school history.
