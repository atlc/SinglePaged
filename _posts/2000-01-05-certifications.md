### Certifications In Progress
I am currently studying for the *MTA: Networking Fundamentals* and *MTA: Security Fundamentals* certifications, to be obtained shortly after graduation. By the end of 2018, I am aiming to obtain the *CompTIA Network+*, *CompTIA Security+* and *CompTIA Linux+* certifications, the latter of which will also grant me the Linux Professional Institute's *LPIC-1* certification. After that, I will look into branching out towards other networking, security, DBA, Windows & *nix server administration, and other related certifications.
