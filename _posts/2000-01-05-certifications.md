### Planned future certifications
I am currently studying for a few more certifications, and am planning on obtaining the *MTA: Networking Fundamentals* and *MTA: Security Fundamentals* certifications by the end of this year, prior to my graduation. By the end of 2018, I am aiming to obtain the *CompTIA Network+*, *CompTIA Security+* and *CompTIA Linux+* certifications, the latter of which obtaining will also grant me the Linux Professional Institute's *LPIC-1* certification. After that, I will look into branching out towards other networking, security, DBA, Windows & *nix server administration, and other related certifications.
