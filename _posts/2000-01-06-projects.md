## Projects!

---

I really enjoy working with the DOM and using Tampermonkey to manipulate it. My Tampermonkey repo is full of miscellaneous projects (including some [network printer monitoring scripts](https://github.com/atlc/Tampermonkey-Scripts/blob/master/PrintMonitorMaster.js) for work).

One of my favorites is [ChaosProTips](https://github.com/atlc/Tampermonkey-Scripts/blob/master/ChaosProTips.js). That takes a multireddit of the 'LifeProTips', 'UnethicalLifeProTips', 'ShittyLifeProTips', and 'IllegalLifeProTips'subreddits, strips out all identifying info about the subreddits on the page, and if it finds any instance of 'LPT', 'ULPT', 'SLPT', or 'ILPT' in the title, it strips it out and replaces it with a randomized one. It works for both the old reddit style and the new redesign!

In Arduinoventures (take 3), I created a Stranger Things-themed "alphabet light" with Neopixels for a Christmas door-decoration contest that would [spell out 'JEFF STATE' and then return to randomized colors](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ehDYhQQ1Lt36eA6Cd7H69YX7kSLyr5Az/view?usp=sharing). Code for this available [here](https://github.com/atlc/JSCC-Doors-2018/blob/master/Me/Door.ino).

In my second adventure with Arduino and getting my hands dirty with C++, I created the electronics and programming setup for [two anglerfish costumes (video link with audio)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Xm95aun4PjOvnhTsTIxgxcE1eDkLGnc/view?usp=sharing) to celebrate Halloween 2018 festivities with my partner.

Getting into my [second dive with React](https://github.com/atlc/routing-in-react), I created a mobile-responsive app that pulls data from the Studio Ghibli API to populate cards with information from certain endpoints navigated by React Router.

There is a [working demo](https://atlc.github.io/routing-in-react/), but GitHub Pages' project sites do not play well with routing to individual IDs so I'll need to host this elsewhere for full functionality.

I'm working on the frontend for [Chirper](https://atlc.github.io/chirper-frontend/), a platform where one can share their musings with the world in "Chirps". This is my first dive into React, so I'll probably be doing a full rewrite when it comes to developing the backend.

[Wear My Heart On My Sleeve](https://github.com/atlc/WearMyHeartOnMySleeve) was an attempt at creating a Halloween costume with a unique 'wearables' functionality. Unfortunately my $1 heartrate sensor from AliExpress was not accurate, so I had the heartrate display a constant number instead.

I set up RetroPie and EmulationStation on a Raspberry Pi and integrated it into the backup camera display from a previous project to allow passengers to play videogames in my car while I am driving.

I used 33 feet of RGB strip lighting, a Raspberry Pi, and the python PIGPIO library to create custom lighting displays on our Christmas tree.

I participated in Vandyhacks II & III, two of Vanderbilt University's annual hackathon. 

At Vandyhacks II, I collaborated with two students from Vanderbilt and a student from Georgia Tech to produce [Space Cowboy](https://github.com/andrewlloydcartwright/SpaceCowboy), a sidescrolling shooter - in SPACE! - for Android. This was my first time doing collaborative programming, and it was a great experience in learning a new framework (Corona) and language (Lua) and creating a full app in the span of a weekend.

At Vandyhacks III, I worked with two UAB students in developing a game based on [hunting down asteroids](https://github.com/andrewlloydcartwright/vandyhacks3) in real-time. Although we didn't finish, it was fun for me to work with Asterrank and NASA's APIs to play with their data and sort through the closest asteroids to us by their estimated monetary value.
