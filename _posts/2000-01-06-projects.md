## Projects!

In my second adventure with Arduino and getting my hands dirty with C++, I created the electronics and programming setup for [two anglerfish costumes (video link with audio)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Xm95aun4PjOvnhTsTIxgxcE1eDkLGnc/view?usp=sharing) to celebrate Halloween 2018 festivities with my partner.

Getting into my [second dive with React](https://github.com/atlc/routing-in-react), I created a mobile-responsive app that pulls data from the Studio Ghibli API to populate cards with information from certain endpoints navigated by React Router.

There is a [working demo](https://atlc.github.io/routing-in-react/), but GitHub Pages' project sites do not play well with routing to individual IDs so I'll need to host this elsewhere for full functionality.

I'm working on the frontend for [Chirper](https://atlc.github.io/chirper-frontend/), a platform where one can share their musings with the world in "Chirps". This is my first dive into React, so I'll probably be doing a full rewrite when it comes to developing the backend.

[Wear My Heart On My Sleeve](https://github.com/atlc/WearMyHeartOnMySleeve) was an attempt at creating a Halloween costume with a unique 'wearables' functionality. Unfortunately my $1 heartrate sensor from AliExpress was not accurate, so I had the heartrate display a constant number instead.

I set up RetroPie and EmulationStation on a Raspberry Pi and integrated it into the backup camera display from a previous project to allow passengers to play videogames in my car while I am driving.

I used 33 feet of RGB strip lighting, a Raspberry Pi, and the python PIGPIO library to create custom lighting displays on our Christmas tree.
