## Projects!

<div>
  <p>[Just My Type](https://atlc.github.io/Just-My-Type/) is a typing game measuring your speed and accuracy. Once you open the page, the time starts counting down, so get ready! Written using jQuery.</p>

<div>
  <p>[Wear My Heart On My Sleeve](https://github.com/atlc/WearMyHeartOnMySleeve) was an attempt at creating a Halloween costume with a unique 'wearables' functionality. Unfortunately my $1 heartrate sensor from AliExpress was not accurate, so I had the heartrate display a constant number instead.</p>

  <p> I setup RetroPie and EmulationStation on a Pi3 and integrated it into the backup camera display from a previous project to allow passengers to play videogames in my car while I am driving. </p>
