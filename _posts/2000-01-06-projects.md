[Wear My Heart On My Sleeve](https://github.com/atlc/WearMyHeartOnMySleeve) was an attempt at creating a Halloween costume with a unique 'wearables' functionality. Unfortunately my $1 heartrate sensor from AliExpress was not accurate, so I had the heartrate display a constant number instead.

I setup RetroPie and EmulationStation on a Raspberry Pi and integrated it into the backup camera display from a previous project to allow passengers to play videogames in my car while I am driving.
