### UberX
#### *Independent Contractor. Jan 2017 - Present*

I have operated as a rideshare driver for Uber, and have provided excellent service over the past few months, managing to maintain a perfect 5.00/5.00 rating and consistenly receive the "Above and Beyond" driver award. Additionally, I recently implemented an electronics project using a Raspberry Pi3 and my existing backup camera screen to create a retro video game emulation station to allow 2 passengers to play classic videogames in the duration of the ride, frequently receiving requests to circle extra blocks so that a Mario Kart match may be finished.

### **Greystone Golf and Country Club**
#### *Server, Bartender, Event Staff. Apr 2011 - Nov 2015*

Over the span of a few years, I worked in a variety of roles, starting in the Aquatics Department in the summers, where I served in reception, in addition to the poolside grill. I later transitioned to the Food and Beverage Department, where I began working outside the summers in various roles related to dining - from serving in a fast, casual, everyday environment all the way to our finest dining events. As event staff, I got to work closely with clients and members as we prepared and setup events from small birthday parties to holiday parties, to giant golf tournaments or weddings spanning hundreds of people.
