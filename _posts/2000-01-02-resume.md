### **UberX & Lyft**
#### *Independent Contractor.    Jan 2017 - Present*

While operating as a rideshare driver for both services, I have provided excellent service, even managing to currently maintain a perfect 5.00/5.00 rating and consistently receive the "Above and Beyond" driver award with Uber. Additionally, I recently implemented a project using a Raspberry Pi3 and RetroPie to create a video game emulation station to allow 2 passengers to play classic videogames in the duration of the ride, frequently receiving requests to circle extra blocks so that a Mario Kart match may be finished.

### **Vincari**
#### *Software Engineer.    May 2016 - Feb 2017 (10 months)*

I created new features and fixed existing bugs for our EMR/Operative documentation webapp, on a stack of Ruby on Rails, Angular.js, and MySQL. I also worked a little with infrastructure work on AWS, primarily in EC2, VPCs, and with S3. A notable feature I did was creating a logging framework using SumoLogic in order to better assist our Implementations Team to track down errors

### **Greystone Golf and Country Club**
#### *Server, Bartender, Event Staff.    Apr 2011 - Nov 2015 (4 years, 10 months)*

Over the span of a few years, I worked in a variety of roles, starting in the Aquatics Department in the summers, where I served in reception, in addition to the poolside grill. I later transitioned to the Food and Beverage Department, where I began working in various roles related to dining - including serving in a fast, casual, everyday environment all the way to our finest dining events. As event staff, I got to work closely with clients and members as we prepared and setup events from small birthday parties to holiday parties, to giant golf tournaments or weddings spanning hundreds of people.
