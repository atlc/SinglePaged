### **Hubbard Systems**
#### *Application Systems Analyst. Nov 2015 - May 2016*

I assisted our clients in everyday usage of our application, and in addition to gaining valuable support skills, I also got to get a little experience in both Windows & Linux server administration, and some work with T-SQL for a small subset of our application.

### **Greystone Golf and Country Club**
#### *Server, Bartender, Event Staff. Apr 2011 - Nov 2015*

Over the span of a few years, I worked in a variety of roles, starting in the Aquatics Department in the summers, where I served in reception, in addition to the poolside grill. I later transitioned to the Food and Beverage Department, where I began working outside the summers in various roles related to dining - from serving in a fast, casual, everyday environment all the way to our finest dining events. As event staff, I got to work closely with clients and members as we prepared and setup events from small birthday parties to holiday parties, to giant golf tournaments or weddings spanning hundreds of people.
