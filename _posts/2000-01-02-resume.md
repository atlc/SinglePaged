### **UberX & Lyft**
#### *Independent Contractor.    Jan 2017 - August 2017*

While operating as a rideshare driver for both services, I provided excellent service, maintaining a perfect 5.00/5.00 rating and consistently received the "Above and Beyond" driver award with Uber. Additionally, I implemented a project using a Raspberry Pi3 and RetroPie to create a video game emulation station to allow 2 passengers to play classic videogames in the duration of the ride, frequently receiving requests to circle extra blocks so that a Mario Kart match (or two) may be finished.
